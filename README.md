# PokeDex.GG

This web application allows users to search for and build customized Pokémon teams. It utilizes a variety of modern web technologies to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience. By providing detailed filtering and team-building features, the application helps users identify the most effective Pokémon for creating optimized and strategic team compositions.


## Roadmap
This was a medium-scale project that benefited greatly from structured project management using our Trello board. As enthusiastic developers, it's easy to get carried away building extra features, which can often extend timelines—something I’ve encountered in past projects. However, for this build, we maintained focus, followed our roadmap, and successfully completed the project within a few short weeks.
